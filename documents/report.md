We extracted all of the elements from the poster and placed the SVG code directly into the index.html file. After reading the descpription of the oblig we thought this was the way we were supposed to do it.
The SVG code came with styling, so we had to remove that from the index.html and add it to the styles.scss. We changed the class names for the SVG's and the paths so that it became more understandable which element it belonged to and what it did. 
Then we placed the SVG elements using top and left so that it would look like the original poster. 
Then we decided which elements we would animate and how we would achieve the result we wanted. We decided to animate the two stars beside the moon, the car and some of the clouds.

Animated some of the "clouds" using animateTransform type="translate" to make it move side to side to make a "shiver" effect.
Some of the other clouds is animated using animateTransform type="scale" to make them scale up and down in size.
By adding animations to the clouds we felt that it highlighted one of the keypoints that the poster is trying to emphasize, that each and every one of us must try to minimize our carbon footprint.
