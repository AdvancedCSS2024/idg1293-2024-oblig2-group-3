The stars next to the moon were animated using CSS keyframe rotate animations. Very simple animations that fit the objects without needing much code. Meant to make the stars look like they're twinkling/sparkling in the sky. [Code from geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-shake-an-image-using-css-keyframe/)

The car got a curved SMIL path animation, in order to highlight the point made about TikTok and trips to the moon.
[Code from Mozilla Developer.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL) Unlike the other elements that used position absolute, the car was not responsive for smaller screens, despite being positoned like other elements using percentage values. An attempt to fix this was made using several media queries, but it still doesn't look quite right on smaller screens.
