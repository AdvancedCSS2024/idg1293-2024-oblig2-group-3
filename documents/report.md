We extracted all of the elements from the poster and placed the SVG code directly into the index.html. After reading the descpription of the oblig we thought this was the way we were supposed to do it.

Animated some of the "clouds" using animateTransform type="translate" to make it move side to side to make a "shiver" effect.
Some of the other clouds is animated using animateTransform type="scale" to make them scale up and down in size.
By adding animations to the clouds we felt that it highlighted one of the keypoints that the poster is trying to emphasize
